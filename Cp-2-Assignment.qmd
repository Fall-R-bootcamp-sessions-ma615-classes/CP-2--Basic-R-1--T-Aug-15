# Cp-2 Assignment

# Exercise 1

Create the vector (2,0,2,3) and assign it to `aVector`

```{r}
aVector <- c(2,0,2,3)
```

# Exercise 2

-   Create the vector (20,19,18,17,16,...,0). Call your vector
    `tweVector`

-   Create the vector (2,1.9,1.8,1.7,1.6,...,0). Call your vector
    `twe.Vector`

-   Create the vector (2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2), use the rep function. Call your
    vector `twoVector`

```{r}
tweVector <- 20:16
twe.Vector <- seq(2,1.6,-0.1)
twoVector <- rep(2, time = 8)
```
# Exercise 3

 Create a vector with the first 7 elements of pi. Call your vector `piVector`. After, using `rev` and `sort` create, `pieVector` with the `piVector` elements in decreasing order and `eipVector` with the elements in increasing order.  
```{r}
piVector <- c(3,1,4,1,5,9,3)
eipVector <- sort(piVector)
pieVector <- rev(eipVector)
```

# Exercise 4
Construct a vector called `megaVector` that contains the following elements:
- the first and last element of `piVector`
- the elements of `pieVector` equal to `3`
- and the third and fourth elements of `eipVector`

```{r}
megaVector <- c(piVector[1],
                piVector[7],
                pieVector[pieVector %in% c(3)],
                eipVector[3:4])
```

# Exercise 5
Use logical operators in your vector selections to construct the following from the `rivers` vector:
- `noMeanRivers` :Rivers less than 200 miles and rivers more than 600 miles
- `river301` :Rivers that are exactly 301 miles long
- ``specRivers` :Rivers between 100 and 200 miles, as well as rivers between 500 and 600 miles, do not include rivers equal to 135

```{r}
noMeanRivers <- rivers[(rivers < 200) | (rivers > 600)]
river301 <- rivers[rivers == 301]
specRivers <- rivers[(((rivers > 100) & (rivers < 200)) | ((rivers > 500) & (rivers < 600))) & (rivers != 135)]
```


# Exercise 6
Write a function that prints a message citing a relativity sized river given a positive integer representing miles, use the following rivers as breakpoints:
- Feather River: 73 miles
- Des Moines River: 525 miles
- Rio Grande River: 1896 miles

Your function should return a string in the following format:
A river X miles long is shorter than/longer than/exactly as long the "most similar river from above".

```{r}
riverReport <- function(miles) {
  fr <- 73
  dm <- 525
  rg <- 1896
  
  bp1 <- (dm - fr)/2
  bp2 <- (rg - dm)/2
  frName <- "the Feather River."
  dmName <- "the Des Moines River."
  rgName <- "the Rio Grande River."
  report <- NA
  # miles < fr
  if(miles < fr){report <- paste("A river", miles, "miles long is shorter than", frName)}
  # miles == fr
  if(miles == fr){report <- paste("A river", miles, "miles long is exactly as long as", frName)}
  # fr < miles < bp1
  if((miles > fr) & (miles < bp1)){report <- paste("A river", miles, "miles long is longer than", frName)}
  # bp1 <= miles < dm
  if((miles >= bp1) & (miles < dm)){report <- paste("A river", miles, "miles long is shorter than", dmName)}
  # miles == dm
  if(miles == dm){report <- paste("A river", miles, "miles long is exactly as long as", dmName)}
  # dm < miles < bp2
  if((miles > dm) & (miles < bp2)){report <- paste("A river", miles, "miles long is longer than", dmName)}
  # bp2 <= miles < rg
  if((miles >= bp2) & (miles < rg)){report <- paste("A river", miles, "miles long is shorter than", rgName)}
  # miles == rg
  if(miles == fr){report <- paste("A river", miles, "miles long is exactly as long as", rgName)}
  # miles > rg
  if(miles > rg){report <- paste("A river", miles, "miles long is longer than", rgName)}
  print(report)
  return(report)
}
```


```{r}
#tests
riverReport(river301)
sapply(rivers, riverReport)
```
